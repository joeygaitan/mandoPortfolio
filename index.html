        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Din Djarin better know around the outer rim as Mando. Mando's educational journey started off during his childhood as when he was
            saved from droids and then Adopted in mandalorian Covert. He was trained
            in multiple forms of fighting and weapons. His armor gives him an edge over the competition being blaster and saber proof.
